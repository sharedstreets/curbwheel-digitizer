To import a survey, append the url with `?survey=<surveyPath>`, where `surveyPath` is the URL to the survey. At this path, it anticipates a file structure resembling [this sample survey](https://github.com/sharedstreets/curblr-digitizer/tree/master/src/sampleSurvey), with a `points.json`, `spans.json`, and `images` folder.
